# NOTE: the Piper 1.x command line is different from the 0.x/1.3 one you may
# find in older tutorials. Voices are downloaded explicitly, and the entry
# point is `python3 -m piper`, not a `piper` binary on PATH.

#   python3 -m piper.download_voices en_GB-jenny_dioco-medium --data-dir "$VOICES_DIR"

# Same text, slower and quieter — Piper exposes prosody knobs:
